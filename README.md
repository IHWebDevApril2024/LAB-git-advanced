# LAB || ADVANCED GIT METHODS

## Description

This lab is about practicing advanced git methods. Some of them you already know, some of them you will learn today.

VS code has a tool to work with git. But in this lab we are going to use the terminal.

## Iteration 1 | Create a new branch

Create a new branch called `landing-page`.

```bash
git checkout -b landing-page
```

The checkout -b command creates a new branch and switches to it. Check that you are now in the correct branch.

```bash
git branch
```

This should display a list of branches. The one with the asterisk is the one you are currently in (should be landing-page).

## Iteration 2 | Create a new file

Create a new file called `index.html` and add the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Landing Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to our landing page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Easy right? Just copy and paste the code above into a new file called `index.html`.

## Iteration 3 | Add and commit

When we are done by creating the file, we need to add it to the staging area. Staging area is like a the carton box where you put all the things you want to send to your friend. In this case, the friend is the repository ðŸ˜Ž.

```bash
git add index.html
```

The command `git add` adds the file to the staging area. We can also add all the files at once by using the command `git add .`.

```bash
git add .
```

Now we need to commit the changes. Commit is like adding a note to the box. You can write a message to describe what you are sending.

```bash
git commit -m "Add index.html"
```

It's good to have a clear message to know what you did in that commit. The `-m` flag is used to add a message.

Nothing complicated, right? Let's move on.

## Iteration 4 | Push the branch

Now we need to push the branch to the repository. This is like sending the box to your friend (the repository).

```bash
git push origin landing-page
```

The `origin` is the name of the remote repository (in this case, this lab cloned from github). The `landing-page` is the name of the branch.

## Iteration 5 | Generating a conflict
We are going to create a conflict. We are going to change the `index.html` file also in the `main` branch. Remember what we said in class? Don't modify the same file in different branches or don't work in the same branch more than one person. 

Switch to the `main` branch.

```bash
git checkout main
```

Create a new file called `index.html` and add the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Home</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to our home page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Add and commit the changes.

## Iteration 6 | Merge the branches
We are being naughty ðŸ™ˆ and we are going to merge the branches.
Let's merge the `landing-page` branch into the `main` branch.

```bash
git merge landing-page
```

We can merge directly from the terminal. If there is a conflict, we need to solve it. We can open the file in VS code and solve the conflict.

Check the Source Control tab in VS code. You will see the file with the conflict. You can choose to keep the changes from the `main` branch or the `landing-page` branch.

![Source control](/screenshots/01.png)

In this screenshot there is a merging conflict with the readme file. 
In your case it will be the `index.html` file.

To solve the conflict, you need to remove the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and keep the changes you want.

After solving the conflict, you need to add and commit the changes.

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Solve conflict"
git push origin main
```

Now the `main` branch has the latest changes.

## Iteration 7 | Delete the branch
How do we delete a branch that we don't need anymore? We can do it from the terminal.

```bash
git branch -d landing-page
```

The `-d` flag is used to delete the branch. 

## Iteration 8 | Update the changes on github

Now we need to update the changes on github so it doesn't have the `landing-page` branch anymore.

```bash 
git push origin --delete landing-page
```

This command deletes the branch from the remote repository. Crazy right? ðŸ˜œ
You can also delete the branch from the github interface.

## Iteration 9 | Go back in time ðŸš—ðŸ”¥
Yes, we can go back in time. We can go back to a previous commit. We can do this by using the `git log` command.

```bash
git log
```

The log is going to display a list of commits. Each commit has a hash. We can use the hash to go back to a previous commit.
Example of what we can see in the log:
```bash
commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t
Author: John Doe <john@doe.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 1 00:00:00 2021 +0100

    Add index.html
```
In case we have a lot of commits, we are going to see a lot of these blocks. Every time we press the `j` key, we are going to go down in the list. If we press the `k` key, we are going to go up in the list. To exit the log, we need to press the `q` key.

The first commit that we see is the latest commit. The last commit is the first commit.

To go back to a previous commit, we need to use the `git checkout` command.

```bash
git checkout 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t
```

In your case you need to use the hash of the commit you want to go back to.

Congratulations! You have gone back in time. ðŸš—ðŸ”¥
Now what? You can create a new branch from this commit and continue working from there.

## Iteration 10 | Create a new branch from a previous commit

Create a new branch from the commit you are in.

```bash
git checkout -b new-page
```

Now you are in a new branch called `new-page`. You can continue working from there.

## Iteration 11 | Revert a commit

We can also revert a commit. This is like going back in time but keeping the changes. We can do this by using the `git revert` command.

First let's create a few modifications we don't want. Again, we are being naughty ðŸ™ˆ.

Add random text to the `index.html` file and commit the changes.

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add random text"
git push origin new-page
```

Now we need to revert the commit.

```bash
git log
```

Check the hash of the commit you want to revert. Use the `git revert` command and add a message.

```bash
git revert 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t -m "Revert the changes"
```

This command is going to create a new commit that reverts the changes from the commit you specified.

In case it's a merge commit, you need to specify the parent number. In this case, we are using `-m 1`. 
How do we know if it's a merge commit? We can check the log. 

A merge commit looks like this:

```bash
commit 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t
Merge: 1a2b3c4 5e6f7g8
Author: John Doe <john@doe.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 1 00:00:00 2021 +0100

    Merge branch 'landing-page'
```
Notice we have the word `Merge` in the commit. This is a merge commit.

Where do we see the parent number? In the `Merge` line. In this case, we have two parents. The first parent is `1a2b3c4` and the second parent is `5e6f7g8`. We need to specify the parent number when we revert a merge commit.

## Iteration 12 | Update the changes on github

Now we need to update the changes on github.

```bash
git push origin new-page
```

That's it!

## Iteration 13 | Rebase

Rebase is another way to merge branches. It's like merging but it's going to keep the history clean. 

Let's create a new branch called `new-feature`.

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

Create a new js file called `script.js` and add the following content:

```js
console.log("Hello world");
```

Add and commit the changes.

```bash
git add script.js
git commit -m "Add script.js"
```

Now create a new file called `style.css` and add the following content:

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

Add and commit the changes.

```bash
git add style.css
git commit -m "Add style.css"
```

Now we are going to rebase the `new-feature` branch into the `main` branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git rebase new-feature
```

What happened? The rebase just moved the commits from the `new-feature` branch to the `main` branch. Let's check the log.

```bash
git log
```

Now the `main` branch has the commits from the `new-feature` branch. 

When is this useful? When we have a lot of commits and we want to keep the history clean. 

Now we need to push the changes to github.

```bash
git push origin main
```

That's it! You have learned how to rebase.

## Iteration 14 | Reset

We can also reset the changes. This is like going back in time but it's going to remove the changes.

Let's create a new file in the main branch called `reset.js` and add the following content:

```javascript
console.log("Reset");
```

Add and commit the changes.

```bash
git add reset.js
git commit -m "Add reset.js"
```

Now we are going to reset the changes.

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

The `HEAD~1` is going to reset the last commit. The `--hard` flag is going to remove the changes.

Now the `reset.js` file is gone.

In case we want to reset to a specific commit, we can use the hash of the commit.

```bash
git reset --hard 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t
```

And that's it! Thi is going to reset the changes to the commit you specified and remove them. Be careful with this command. It's like a bomb. ðŸ’£
